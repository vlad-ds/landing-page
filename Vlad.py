      Learning data science at Le Wagon Berlin
      has boosted my confidence and skills. I learned about machine learning,
      neural networks, and data engineering.
      For me the best part was learning how to structure and package
      Python code and how to build, deploy and monitor machine learning pipelines
      in the cloud.

      I had data on over 10 million trips from cellphone records (XDR).
      I programmed an algorithm that computed the difference in mobility from a
      baseline rate. Then I packaged the ETL pipeline in a Python library and wrote

      I collected data by scraping the web, calling APIs, and downloading a massive
      database of scientific publications from Amazon S3.

      I cleaned, preprocessed and transformed the data. I ran complex statistical
      anaylses. I surveyed the literature and reproduced complex algorithms. I worked
      with graphs and Markovian simulations.

      Finally, I wrote a paper and learned to make publication-ready plots.

      I met a professor who had gathered data on the social interactions of
      his students over three years. We reconstructed their networks and found
      clear evidence of the impact of network position on academic performance.

      After graduation, I received a grant to complete this project.
      I also interned in a data consultancy

## What I'm looking for

I am **open to work** in Berlin or remotely.

I am looking for a place where I can be challenged to improve every day.
Team work and mentorship are very important to me.

I love building robust, scalable systems to retrieve, transform and analyse data.
I aspire to grow into the role of **Data Engineer**.

I am currently working on **Find Your Dream Job**, a tool that will allow job hunters
to gather job postings and extract insights on the job market. This is my final
project for the Le Wagon Data Science Bootcamp.

My next objective is to earn the **AWS Cloud Associate** certification.
